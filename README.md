# Grand Tourismo Sport Randomiser
Randomiser for "fun" GT Sport lobbies

Currently, just collects all the selections and will spit out a random combination.

Improvents List:
- ~~Turn on/off groups of tracks (Done)~~
- ~~Presets eg: ovals, short tracks only, real tracks only, no rally (Done)~~
- somewhat intelegent filtering to avoid something silly like 20 laps in n100 at Nordshlife with max tyre and fuel (Although then it wouldnt be fully random) and incorrect outputs like you cant do group 1/2/3/4/x on dirt/snow tracks
- Support for more settings such as Tyre Wear, fuel, and power limit for group x
