# Grand Tourismo Sport Randomiser
Randomiser for "fun" GT Sport lobbies

Currently, just collects all the selections and will spit out a random combination.

Improvents List:
- Turn on/off groups of tracks
- Presets eg: ovals, short tracks only, real tracks only, no rally
- Support for more settings such as Tyre Wear & Fuel
- somewhat intelegent filtering to avoid something silly like 20 laps in n100 at Nordshlife with max tyre and fuel (Although then it wouldnt be fully random)
